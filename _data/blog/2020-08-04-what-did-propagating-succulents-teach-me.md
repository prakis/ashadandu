Out of all the hobbies I've developed, gardening is one that has always stayed with me no matter where I lived. I've tried growing my own green leafy vegetables, seasonal flowers and pothos. The one plant family that has never failed to amaze me is Succulents. 

Succulents are supposedly hard to kill plants, fyi. Let alone propagating, I couldn't even keep them alive for more than a few months. Every time one succulent (or any plant for that matter) died, it was quite depressing. I would then decide never to buy any in the future. But eventually I would end up buying some plants after a few months. 

Giving the combination of me, gardening and the depression when I lost a plant, over the last couple months I started introspecting and researching on myself. I've learnt some important life lessons during this journey. I would like to name them together as PERC (read Perk). 

**Patience:** Who wouldn't love instant results in the current generation? I am no exception either üòâ I am willing to be patient asked to, but inside my head I would be happy to have an overnight progress. That wasn't the case while propagating succulents. It took me good 1.5 months and around 30 leaves to see a small progress. Boy-o-boy the patience definitely paid off when I saw tiny leaves peeping out üåµ 

**Effort:** Everyone around me know that I am quite lazy. I used to think its okay to be lazy. I would presume that the plants would grow by themselves. All they need is be thrown in the sunlight and pour some water whenever. But that was not the case. Never cared to know that each plant needs different care and some love too.

**Research:** The world with Google is much easier to live in. I could have found answers to any question. But did I do enough research about taking care of or propagating succulents even when I knew I had to? The answer is not until very recently. 

**Consistence:** Something I often consider as an important skill in every stage of life. I tried my best ways to let these leaves propagate. Tried propagating some leaves through water vapor and some in soil. Out of 25-30 leaves I only have about 7 showing some results. The catch is, it always looks impossible until you really try anything in life. 

Though I've learnt my lessons the hard way, I'm glad I've learnt them. I'll try to apply these in everything I do. I wish it did make sense to some of you at least.  

PS: I just called them collective as PERC but that doesn't define any order. All of them are equally important in life is what I feel üòÅ 

See you next time !!
