I have talked about the basic rules or tips to follow while looking for domain names in my first blog. This one will be about domain extensions and how to choose one.

While there are about 280 domain extensions, its not very hard to choose one for your domain. I'll try and make it simple without getting into technical names. 

**Most Popular Extensions** are .COM - stands for commercial, .NET - network, .INFO - information, .ORG - organisation, .GOV - government, .EDU - education. The 'DOT COM' domain extension is quite a popular one that most of the meaningful domains are being taken and some are sold for hundreds of dollars or even thousands sometimes. But some lucky ones come up with a tricky name and manage to find a 'DOT COM' domain. I managed to get one too ðŸ˜‰ (www.tealpod.com). 

Let's not get disheartened here. We have a bunch of other extensions that cater to each purpose. 

\* Most technology developers choose .DEV, .TECH., 

\* Start-ups go with .IO, .APP, .AI etc,. 

\* For personal blogging .ME, .BLOG, .BIO, .PAGE, .WEBSITE work best. You can get as creative as you can to find a catchy domain name. 

Some extensions that I really find interesting are .INK, .FYI, .RUN, .WTF, .FUN, .BINGO, .SPACE, etc,. 

There are others that stand for country codes like .uk for United Kingdom, .in - India, .nz - New Zealand, .ca - Canada and others. 

**Places to buy/search domain names:**

<https://domains.google/> - my first preference 

<https://leandomainsearch.com/> - my personal favorite 

[https://www.namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)

<https://porkbun.com/> - Right now porkbun is offering first three domains for $4.15  

To those who don't know, buying and selling domain names is a side hustle for many. Some end up earning hundreds of dollars. Try it if you think that's your thing :)
